# midee vs SeeMusic: honest comparison

SeeMusic is one of the best-known MIDI visualizers among music educators and serious piano YouTubers. It's a paid, native desktop app for Windows and macOS, made by Visual Musical Minds. If you've found your way here, you're probably wondering:

- "Do I actually need to pay for SeeMusic, or is there a free version that's good enough?"
- "Can I do this in a browser instead of installing another desktop app?"

**[midee](/)** is the free, browser-native option. This page walks through what SeeMusic does well, where midee fits, and how to pick between them.

## Quick comparison

|  | SeeMusic | midee |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Platform | Windows, macOS (native) | Any modern browser |
| Cost | Paid tiers / paid export features | **Free, forever** |
| Open source | No | Yes, MIT license |
| Install required | Yes, ~500 MB | No |
| MP4 export | Yes (watermarked on free tier) | **Yes, never watermarked** |
| Vertical aspect (TikTok / Reels) | Paid tier | **Free** |
| Live MIDI controller input | Yes | Yes |
| Loop station with bar-snapped layering | No | **Yes** |
| Session recording / `.mid` bounce | Limited | Yes |
| Visual themes | Yes, extensive | Yes, five themes + particle styles |
| Runs on Linux / Chromebook | No | Yes |
| Your files leave your device? | Depends on tier | No — fully client-side |

## Where SeeMusic wins

SeeMusic has been in the space for years and has features midee doesn't:

- **Custom skins and animations.** SeeMusic's visual library is deep. You can pick from dozens of pre-made styles, configure particle density, camera motion, etc.
- **Professional polish for teachers.** The score display, fingering, and note-label options are tuned for classroom use.
- **Precise video rendering pipeline.** SeeMusic's native rendering uses the full capability of the GPU and handles complex scenes at high resolution smoothly.
- **Multi-track mixing controls.** Per-track volume, pan, and solo controls for arrangements.

If you're a teacher making polished demonstration videos daily or a full-time music YouTuber who needs every frame under control, SeeMusic is a mature, battle-tested tool worth the license.

## Where midee fits

midee is the browser-first, design-forward, open-source option for everyone who doesn't need the full SeeMusic kit.

- **No install, no license key.** Open [midee.app](/), drag in a `.mid`, and you're rendering. Works on Chromebooks, locked-down work laptops, Linux — anywhere SeeMusic doesn't run.
- **No watermark, ever.** midee's MP4 export is clean on the free tier because there *is* no paid tier. MIT-licensed.
- **Fully client-side.** Your MIDI file and the rendered video never leave your browser.
- **Vertical export out of the box.** TikTok/Reels 9:16, square 1:1, 1080p, 720p, or native aspect ratio — all free, all built-in.
- **Loop station + live play.** Jam with a MIDI controller, loop a phrase bar-snapped to the metronome, layer takes, record sessions. This is the one category where midee does something SeeMusic doesn't.
- **Open source.** The [source is on GitHub](https://github.com/aayushdutt/midee). Fork it, submit themes and particle styles, audit the code.

## When to pick which

Use **SeeMusic** if:

- You render 20 videos a month and need every visual parameter tuned precisely.
- You're already on Windows or macOS and a paid license is fine with you.
- You need features midee doesn't yet have: score overlay with fingering, per-instrument animated characters, very specific camera cinematography.

Use **midee** if:

- You want to render a nice-looking piano-roll video for Reels / TikTok / YouTube without paying or installing anything.
- You're on Linux, a Chromebook, or any platform SeeMusic doesn't support.
- You prefer open-source tools.
- You want to jam on your MIDI keyboard and record loops *alongside* the visualizer, not in a separate DAW.
- You want "drop and go" — try it, render it, share it, without commitment.

## Common questions

**Is midee's video quality comparable to SeeMusic's?**
For most use cases, yes. midee renders at 60fps with baked-in audio, frame-accurate via WebCodecs. The output is plain H.264 MP4 that uploads to YouTube, TikTok, and Reels without any re-encoding on their side. The aesthetic is different — midee leans clean and design-forward; SeeMusic leans cinematic with more camera motion options — so pick the look you prefer.

**Does midee require internet?**
Only on first load. Once the app is cached, MIDI playback and video export work offline.

**Will midee eventually charge?**
No plans to. The project is MIT-licensed, indie, and built because existing options demanded money, uploads, or installs. If features land that need server costs (hosted galleries, collaborative features), those will be opt-in and priced separately, and the core visualizer + export will stay free.

**Can I install midee as a desktop app?**
Yes — modern browsers let you "Install" a web app from the URL bar. It runs in its own window, pinnable in the dock. midee ships a web manifest so this works cleanly.

## Try it

Trying SeeMusic means downloading ~500 MB and creating an account. Trying midee is one click. [Open it](/), drop in a `.mid`, and see if it earns a place in your workflow.
