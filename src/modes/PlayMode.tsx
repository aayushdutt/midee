// load" path. For the "re-entry from live/learn" path, loadedMidi was
// preserved from the earlier play session.

// Why createEffect for the renderer side? New-file-loaded while already in
// play mode changes `loadedMidi` without remounting the component. The
// effect re-runs on that change so the renderer/trackPanel/title all
// reflect the new file.
